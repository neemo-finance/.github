# Welcome to Neemo Finance GitHub!  👋

## What is Neemo Finance ?
Neemo Finance is a multichain and non-custodial liquid staking solution built for the Astar Network. It allows users to liquid stake their ASTR on their favourite dApps and earn returns on it. Neemo Finance offers higher degree of flexibility in liquid dApp staking to users by offering dual staking modes. These modes allow users to either: 

- mint nsASTR instantly and earn dApp staking rewards, or
- timelock their ASTR for the entire Voting and Build&Earn Subperiods and earn Bonus Rewards too

Additionally, Neemo Finance incorporates DeFi strategies for the Timelocked staking feature, allowing users to earn boosted rewards on top of Bonus Rewards! 

When users deposit on Neemo Finance, they get nsASTR, a non-rebasing token that increases in price over time.
